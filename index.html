        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Maryann Bonilla. I am a mother of two, and I currently live in Riverside, California. On my free time, I like to take my daughters on adventures like hiking or camping. I also have a passion for the art of makeup artistry. I attended Ruby Makeup Academy where I graduated as a Professional Makeup Artist in 2014. I have worked for Univision and KTLA 5 as a makeup artist for Dia de Los Muertos face painting. That was very fun. I guess you can say that it is one of my hidden talents since I no longer do it as my full-time job.  <br><br>

        I have several other areas of experience based on previous jobs. I have worked in customer service for more than 10 years. I have 2 yearsâ€™ experience in early childhood education. I have also worked in the banking industry for five years. After gaining my experience in those areas, I decided it would be best to return to school to further my passion in teaching. When my oldest daughter started kindergarten, I was advised to have her further evaluated by the school. I decided to accept the resources given to me, knowing that I needed to do everything possible to help my daughter achieve everything she is fully capable of. My daughter entered the Individualized Education Program (IEP), and working closely with the IEP team, I knew I had to do my part to help as best I could. I started taking a few childhood education classes at my local community college. I never thought it would be more than that. In 2021, I applied to the University of California, Riverside and got accepted to attend school there. I never thought I would be in college again, let alone attend a university. Now, 5 years later, I am graduating as a Liberal Studies major to help children in the classroom just like my daughter. I will be graduating in Summer of 2024. <br><br>

        Teaching is something that I have always wanted to do since I was a young child. Now, I can say that I am almost there. Returning to school not only helped me with my daughter, but it also helped me learn so much about myself. Most importantly, I learned so much about so many other cultures. I also believe that my previous experience has helped me with the same understanding. There is an art in serving food. There is an art in recreating makeup looks. There is an art in being creative when it comes to customer service. I also believe that it is an art helping young minds learn during the most important years of their lives. The most important think through school and all the experience I have gained over the years is that patience is very important, and people will never forget how you made them feel. Please, feel free to ask me any questions that you may have. I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
